# OpenADB 3.0.0 release progress

Updated: 13 July 2026.

Statuses: `not started`, `in progress`, `completed`, `blocked`.

> A commit cannot contain its own final SHA because changing the recorded SHA
> changes that commit. The current stage therefore uses `HEAD` plus its exact
> commit subject; the next stage replaces it with the stable short SHA.

| 2 | Immutable device contexts and generation tokens | **completed** | `openadb/core/device_context.py`, `operations.py`, bound ADB/fastboot/runner/file transfer, device/profile transactions, ACBridge/P2P/backup cancellation, worker lifecycle and stale-result guards across Apps, Backups, File Manager, Commands, Dashboard, status and Wireless ADB; context/lifecycle regression tests | 263 unittest in 246.164 s; focused context/registry/runner/P2P/FM/Apps/Wireless/settings/Main suites (178/178); full `compileall`; full Ruff; `git diff --check` | Offscreen/mock validation only for device switching and transfers; no real Android hardware, network pairing, or dangerous ADB/fastboot command was used | `HEAD` — `core: bind device operations to immutable contexts` |
